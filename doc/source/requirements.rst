Requirements
============

TOAD is generally deployed in Docker containers. You can choose to
deploy using Docker, or, together with an existing OpenStack deployment.
Below you will find the list of requirements for each of the deployment
scenarios.

For Ansible, several roles are required, and you can install them as
follows:

::

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

Docker
------

TOAD primarily utilizes Docker containers. In order to use Docker, you
need to install `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__.

At present, our ``docker-compose`` YAML file uses the version 2
specification, and should work with docker-compose version 1.6.0 or
greater, and Docker engine 1.10.0 or later.

OpenStack
---------

You'll need to install the ``shade`` dependency so that you can interact
with OpenStack (assuming you are deploying to an OpenStack cloud).

::

    pip install --user shade

Setup OpenStack Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're going to install to an OpenStack cloud, you'll need to
configure a cloud to connect to. You can do this by creating the
``~/.config/openstack/`` directory and placing the following contents
into the ``clouds.yml`` file within that directory (adjust to your own
cloud connection):

::

    clouds:
        mycloud:
            auth:
                auth_url: http://theclowd.com:5000/v2.0
                username: cloud_user
                password: cloud_pass
                project_name: "My Cloud Project"
